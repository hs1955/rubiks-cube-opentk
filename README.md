# rubiks-cube-opentk
My Rubik's Cube Project made with OpenTK (OpenGL). This repo is a showcase of this project.

The goal of this project is to help new users to Rubik's Cubes solve their own cubes, with the assistance of this program.
This is also one of my first major coding projects.

This program solves Rubik's Cubes with the Layer by Layer method, which is the simplest method (and also longest method time-wise).
But its good for beginners to the 3x3 Rubik's Cube.

The Net Menu only has basic error checking, and doesn't check for pieces that can't exist.

My program relies on Windows Form App, thus only runs on Windows.
Here's the SHA256 hash for my rubiks-cube-release.7z: 536A1F2F5A3E134BEC8F88B72EF42386F3454342D0377A4B1377F1EA1299ED1D

I've checked my release file on VirusTotal, and it doesn't get flagged for anything.
There's no file/path handling actively used in the code either.

This repository is also archived and read-only. I do not plan to make further changes to this project.
