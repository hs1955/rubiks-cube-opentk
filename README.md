# rubiks-cube-opentk
My Rubiks Cube Project made with OpenTK (OpenGL).

The goal of this project is to help new users to Rubik's Cubes solve their own cubes, with the assistance of this program.

This program solves Rubik's Cubes with the Layer by Layer method, which is the simplest method, and also longest method time-wise.
